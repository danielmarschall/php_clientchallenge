# Server requests using client challenges

### What is it?
This PHP/JavaScript package can be used to add client challenges on top of your
AJAX requests to protect your scripts against brute-force or DoS attacks.
It can also protect your server against resource starvation attacks, for example,
if you have a login script that uses a complex hash algorithm like BCrypt.

### Usage example
A usage example is located in the directory example/

### System requirements
- PHP compatible web-server (tested with Apache 2, nginx, and Microsoft IIS)
- PHP 7.0 or higher (also tested with PHP 8.0)
- Independent of operating system (tested with Windows, Linux, and macOS X)
